Add .lua scripts here!
Lua scripts in this folder will be loaded on all songs, no matter the difficulty, song name, week or anything.

If you've put it inside a modpack, as long as the modpack is loaded, the script will be running.

Btw you don't need to put stuff like "backend.ClientPrefs" you can leave it as "ClientPrefs" as it will correct itself to
the right folder. (You can still do the same and it'll still work)
Although not all are listed
